# interview-problems

In the process of preparing solutions for Advent of Code 2016 problems 1, 4 and 10 for interview with Apple.

Since they all begin with parsing some kind of input data, I have decided this will be a perfect job for [Instaparse](https://github.com/Engelberg/instaparse). 

My complete ramblings are recorded in my [blog](https://crjunkie.blogspot.com/2017/11/my-interview-for-apple.html).
